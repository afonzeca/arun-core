 * Class ArunCore allows to kickstart the application
 * by executing the DOMAIN:ACTION requested from CLI
 * using the DomainActionExecutor class.
 *
 * Classes are instantiated via DI Container according to their contracts
 *
 * NOTE: At the moment the ArunCore acts only as a DomainActionExecutor caller due to the early stage of the project.
 * I choose to not call directly the DomainActionExecutor class from App because I will introduce other functionalities
 * that will be processed at ArunCore level
 *
 * First Release Date:26/09/18
